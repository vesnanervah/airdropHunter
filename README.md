# This is a test task for AirDrop Hunter startup

Many of features in design are not described, yet exist, like blockchains slider-carousel or news slider.
So i implemented them as i feel, trying to not waste much time.


## Stack

By interviewer was given stack of vanillaJS(???) and Bootstrap4(???)...*But since i already failed interview* (or idk cuz interviewer just ignores me) **the stack is**:
- TypeScript
- Webpack
- Sass
- FontAwesome

*I would also use Angular, but it will be too different from the original stack.*

## Deploy

You can view deploy of the app [here](https://vesnanervah.github.io/airdropHunter/dist/index.html).
